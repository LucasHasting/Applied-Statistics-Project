# Applied-Statistics-Project

This repository holds my project from my Applied Statistics class. The project was to determine if any discrimination was found in the California Department of Defense. R was used for the analysis of the [California_DDS_Expenditures.csv]() file. Instructions on how to use the R file to duplicate this analysis is located below.
